The user interface part of our project was written in Python based on PyQt4 platform. 
And another necessay package for this application is yaml for parsing json files.
 You can install it by typing 'pip install pyyaml'. After installing these two libraries,
 you can use 'python ./src/yelp_ui_pyqt4.py' to run the GUI. Then in the application window 
you can choose a user id to search for user specified restaurant recommendations. You can also
 use the restaurant name, stars and categories to filter the output results.
