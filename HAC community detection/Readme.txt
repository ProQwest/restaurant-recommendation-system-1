This is the HAC program to find the communities in a graph. Given the 'pair.txt' file, which contains pairs of users review the same restaurant. The algorithm can find the communities cooresponding to some stoping cretirias. There are many parameters to be choosen to find the best results. Here is a tried on with jac threshold 0.003 and stop loop 10000. Just simple use command line $python HAC.py . The final cluster will be written as a dict, and output final_community.json.  It takes some time to finish.
